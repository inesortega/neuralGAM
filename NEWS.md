* `verbose` parameter is now used along all the required functions.

* Tensorflow and Keras are now loaded when `library(neuralGAM)` is invoked for the first time, and therefore the first run of the  `neuralGAM()` function has all the required packages ready.

# neuralGAM 1.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
