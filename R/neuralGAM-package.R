#' \code{neuralGAM}: interpretable neural network framework based Generalized Additive Models
#'
#'
#' This package provides a method for fitting (deep) neural networks based on Generalized Additive Models
#' to obtain a highly accurate and explainable deep learning model. The methodology
#' can be applied both in regression and classification frameworks.

#'\code{neuralGAM} is designed along lines similar to those of other \code{R}
#' packages. This software allows the user to fit a set of independent neural networks
#' to estimate the contribution of each feature to the response variable, obtaining a
#' highly accurate and explainable deep learning model.
#' The package provides \code{neuralGAM()} function that fits a set of independent
#' neural networks with a given architecture based on the number of units per layer.
