# NeuralGAM
An R package which provides a Generalized Additive Model implementation with Neural Networks

## Requirements

NeuralGAM is based on Deep Neural Networks, and depends on Tensorflow and Keras packages. Therefore, a working Python installation with Keras and Tensorflow installed is required.

We provide a helper function to set up a conda environment with both dependencies installed: 

```
library(NeuralGAM)
installPythonDeps()
```
