# NeuralGAM
An R package which provides a Generalized Additive Model implementation with Neural Networks

## Requirements

NeuralGAM is based on Deep Neural Networks, and depends on Tensorflow and Keras packages. Therefore, a working Python installation with Keras and Tensorflow installed is required. During installation, the package will generate a customized `conda` environment and install the required libraries. 

```
library(NeuralGAM)
```
