\usage{
\method{autoplot}{neuralGAM}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  which = c("response", "link", "terms"),
  interval = c("none", "confidence", "prediction", "both", "aleatoric"),
  level = 0.95,
  term = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{neuralGAM} object.}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{data.frame}/list of covariates. If omitted, training data are used.}

\item{which}{One of \code{c("response","link","terms")}. Default \code{"response"}.}

\item{interval}{One of \code{c("none","confidence","prediction","both","aleatoric")}.
Default \code{"confidence"}.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Response scale:} \code{"confidence"} draws epistemic CI for the fitted mean
(SEs on the link mapped via the delta method). \code{"prediction"} draws PIs that reflect
aleatoric noise (and, when the model was trained with combined uncertainty, epistemic too).
\code{"both"} overlays CI and PI.
\item \strong{Link scale:} Only \code{"confidence"} is defined; if \code{interval} requests
\code{"prediction"}, \code{"both"}, or \code{"aleatoric"}, it is coerced to
\code{"confidence"} with a warning.
\item \strong{Terms (per-term effects on the link scale):}
\code{"confidence"} draws epistemic CI for the smooth \eqn{g_j(x_j)} (SE-based).
\code{"aleatoric"} draws \emph{diagnostic} residual quantile bands for partial residuals
\eqn{R_j} (from quantile heads), centered on \eqn{\hat g_j}. \code{"both"} overlays
confidence and aleatoric bands. \code{"prediction"} is not defined for terms and is
coerced to \code{"aleatoric"} with a warning.
}}

\item{level}{Coverage level for intervals (e.g., \code{0.95}). Default \code{0.95}.}

\item{term}{Single term name to plot when \code{which = "terms"}.}

\item{rug}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), add rugs to continuous term plots.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{predict.neuralGAM}.}
}
\value{
A single \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Produce diagnostic and effect plots from a fitted \code{neuralGAM} model.
Supported plot types:
\itemize{
\item \code{which = "response"}: Fitted response vs. index, with optional
\emph{confidence intervals} (CI) and/or \emph{prediction intervals} (PI).
\item \code{which = "link"}: Linear predictor (link scale) vs. index,
with optional CI (PI are not defined on the link scale).
\item \code{which = "terms"}: Single per-term contribution \eqn{g_j(x_j)} on the link scale.
For continuous covariates: line with optional bands. For factor covariates: boxplots per
level with optional mean \eqn{\pm z \cdot SE} error bars and/or aleatoric ranges.
On the terms panel you can display (i) epistemic CI for the smooth \eqn{g_j} and/or
(ii) \emph{aleatoric residual quantile bands} for partial residuals \eqn{R_j}.
}
}
\details{
\strong{Uncertainty semantics}
\itemize{
\item \strong{CI (epistemic):} Uncertainty about the \emph{fitted mean}. For terms, bands are
\eqn{\hat g_j \pm z \cdot SE(\hat g_j)} on the link scale. For the response, SEs are mapped
to the response scale via the delta method.
\item \strong{PI (aleatoric / combined):} Width reflects data noise (aleatoric) and, when the
model was trained with combined uncertainty, also model uncertainty (epistemic). PIs are
provided \emph{only} on the response scale.
\item \strong{Aleatoric residual bands for terms (diagnostic):} For \code{which="terms"},
quantile heads yield residual quantile bands for \eqn{R_j} centered on \eqn{\hat g_j}.
These are intended for diagnostics and \emph{are not} prediction intervals for \eqn{Y}.
