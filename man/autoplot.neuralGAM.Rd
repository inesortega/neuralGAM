}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{neuralGAM} object.}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{data.frame}/list of covariates to evaluate.
If omitted, training data stored in the object are used.}

\item{which}{One of \code{c("response","link","terms")}. Default \code{"response"}.}

\item{interval}{One of \code{c("none","confidence","prediction","both")}.
Default \code{"confidence"}.
\itemize{
\item CI (confidence) is derived from epistemic SEs (\code{pi_method = 'epistemic'}.
\item PI (prediction) is available only if the model was trained with \code{pi_method = 'aleatoric'}.
}}

\item{level}{Coverage level for intervals (e.g., \code{0.95}). Default \code{0.95}.}

\item{term}{When \code{which = "terms"}, the \emph{single} term name to plot.
Users must call \code{autoplot()} multiple times to visualize multiple terms.}

\item{rug}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), add rugs to continuous term plots.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{predict.neuralGAM}.}

\item{terms}{Character vector of term names to plot (for \code{which = "terms"}).
If \code{NULL}, all terms are plotted.}
}
\value{
A single \code{ggplot} object.

A single \code{ggplot} object.

\description{
Produce diagnostic and effect plots from a fitted \code{neuralGAM} model.
Supported plot types:
\itemize{
\item \code{which = "response"}: Fitted response values vs. observation index,
with optional confidence or prediction intervals.
\item \code{which = "link"}: Linear predictor (link scale) vs. observation index,
with optional confidence intervals.
\item \code{which = "terms"}: Per-term contributions (on the link scale),
displayed in a faceted plot:
\itemize{
\item For continuous covariates: line plot with optional ribbons
for confidence intervals (CI) and/or prediction intervals (PI).
\item For factor covariates: box plots of per-observation contributions
by level, with optional mean ± z·SE error bars if available.
}
}

Produce a single diagnostic/effect plot from a fitted \code{neuralGAM} model.
Supported views:
\itemize{
\item \code{which = "response"}: Fitted response vs. index, with optional CI/PI.
\item \code{which = "link"}: Linear predictor (link scale) vs. index, with optional CI.
\item \code{which = "terms"}: \emph{One} per-term contribution (link scale).
For a continuous covariate: line with optional CI/PI ribbons.
For a factor covariate: boxplot by level with optional mean ± z·SE error bars.
}
}
\details{
Intervals:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Confidence intervals (CI):} Derived from epistemic SEs
(like in \code{mgcv}) if the model was trained with \code{pi_method = 'epistemic'}.
On the response scale they are propagated through the delta method.
\item \strong{Prediction intervals (PI):} Capture aleatoric uncertainty
if the model was trained with \code{pi_method = 'aleatoric'}. Constructed
by combining per-term bounds on the link scale and applying the
inverse link.
}

For factor terms, plots display the distribution of per-observation contributions
as box plots. If SEs are available, group means are shown with error bars
representing \eqn{\text{mean} \pm z \times SE}.

Multiple terms are always combined into a single faceted plot (one panel per term).

\strong{CI vs. PI:}
\itemize{
\item CI for the mean uses only epistemic variance (like \code{mgcv}).
\item PI for a new observation uses the model’s PI machinery
(sum per-term bounds on the link scale, then inverse-link). If per-term bounds
are not present but total variance exists, a Normal fallback may be used by
\code{predict.neuralGAM}.
}

When \code{which = "terms"}, this function requires exactly one \code{term}.
This avoids mixing discrete and continuous x scales in a single \code{ggplot}.
