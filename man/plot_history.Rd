\title{Plot training loss history for a neuralGAM model}
\usage{
plot_history(model, select = NULL, metric = c("loss", "val_loss"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted \code{neuralGAM} model.}

\item{select}{Optional character vector of term names (e.g. \code{"x1"} or \code{c("x1", "x3")}) to subset
the history. If \code{NULL} (default), all terms are included.}

\item{metric}{Character vector indicating which loss metric(s) to plot. Options are
\code{"loss"}, \code{"val_loss"}, or both. Defaults to both.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the loss curves by backfitting iteration, with facets per term.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the training and/or validation loss over backfitting iterations
for each term-specific model in a fitted \code{neuralGAM} object. It is designed to work with the
\code{history} component of a trained \code{neuralGAM} model.
}

  set.seed(123)

  y <- 2 + x1^2 + sin(x2) + rnorm(n, 0, 0.1)
