\title{Summary of a \code{neuralGAM} model}
\usage{
\method{summary}{neuralGAM}(object, ...)

\value{
Invisibly returns \code{object}. Prints a human-readable summary.
}
\description{
Summarizes a fitted \code{neuralGAM} object: family, formula, sample size,
intercept, training MSE, per-term neural net settings, per-term NN layer
configuration, and training history. If a linear component is present, its
coefficients are also reported.
